## Problem 1

Create a tidy dataframe containing data from all participants, including the subject ID, arm, and observations over time

#Start with a dataframe containing all file names; the list.files function will help

participant_data = data_frame(list.files(path = "./data_1"))

participant_data

#Iterate over file names and read in data for each subject using purrr::map and saving the result as a new variable in the dataframe



```
