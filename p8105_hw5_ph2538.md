## Problem 1

Create a tidy dataframe containing data from all participants, including
the subject ID, arm, and observations over
time

``` r
#Start with a dataframe containing all file names; the list.files function will help

file_names = 
  data_frame(subID_arm = list.files(path = "./data_1")) %>% 
  mutate(subID_arm = as.character(subID_arm))

#Iterate over file names and read in data for each subject using purrr::map and saving the result as a new variable in the dataframe

#first write function to read in csv files. Function is named file_name.

read_participant_data <- function(file_name) {
  
 read_csv(paste0("data_1/", file_name)) 

}

#map requires dataset and function

participant_data = map_df(file_names$subID_arm, read_participant_data)
```
