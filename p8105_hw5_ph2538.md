## Problem 1

Create a tidy dataframe containing data from all participants, including
the subject ID, arm, and observations over
time

``` r
#Start with a dataframe containing all file names; the list.files function will help

file_names = 
  data_frame(subID_arm = list.files(path = "./data_1")) %>% 
  mutate(subID_arm = as.character(subID_arm))

#Iterate over file names and read in data for each subject using purrr::map and saving the result as a new variable in the dataframe

#first write function to read in csv files. Function is named file_name.

read_participant_data <- function(file_name) {
  
 read_csv(paste0("data_1/", file_name)) 

}

#map requires dataset and function

participant_data = map_df(file_names$subID_arm, read_participant_data)
```

``` r
#Tidy the result; manipulate file names to include control arm and subject ID, make sure weekly observations are “tidy”, and do any other tidying that’s necessary

tidy_participant_data = 
  cbind(file_names, participant_data) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(sub_id_arm = str_replace(sub_id_arm, ".csv", "")) %>% 
  separate(sub_id_arm, into = c("arm", "sub_id"), sep = "_") %>% 
  gather(key = week, value = obs, week_1:week_8) %>% 
  mutate(week = str_replace(week, "week_", "")) %>% 
  mutate(week = as.numeric(week))
```

### Spaghetti plot

``` r
#Make a spaghetti plot showing observations on each subject over time, and comment on differences between groups.

tidy_participant_data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = week, y = obs, color = sub_id)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() +
  facet_grid(~arm) + 
  labs(
    title = "Control vs Experimental Arms, Week 1-8",
    x = "Week",
    y = "Observations"
  )
```

![](p8105_hw5_ph2538_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png)<!-- -->

The spaghetti plot shows that observations for the experimental arm have
much higher values compared to the observations for the control arm. The
control arm values consistently remain at low values, while the
experimental values have a positive increasing trend.

## Problem 2

### Raw data

``` r
#Describe the raw data.
homicide_data = read_csv(file = "./data_2/homicide-data.csv")
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   uid = col_character(),
    ##   reported_date = col_integer(),
    ##   victim_last = col_character(),
    ##   victim_first = col_character(),
    ##   victim_race = col_character(),
    ##   victim_age = col_character(),
    ##   victim_sex = col_character(),
    ##   city = col_character(),
    ##   state = col_character(),
    ##   lat = col_double(),
    ##   lon = col_double(),
    ##   disposition = col_character()
    ## )

The homicide dataset dimensions are 52179, 12, which means it includes
52179 homicide incidents. Key variables include the incident ID,
reported date, victim’s first and last name, city and state of incident,
and disposition. In addition, it also includes victim’s age and race.

### Create city\_state variable and summarize

``` r
#Create a city_state variable (e.g. “Baltimore, MD”)

homicide_data =
  homicide_data %>% 
  mutate(city_state = str_c(city, ", ", state))

#Summarize within cities to obtain the total number of homicides and the number of unsolved homicides (those for which the disposition is “Closed without arrest” or “Open/No arrest”)

total_homicide =
  homicide_data %>% 
  group_by(city_state) %>% 
  summarize(total = n()) %>% 
  filter(city_state == "Baltimore, MD") 
  
unsolved_homicide =
  homicide_data %>%
  filter(disposition == "Closed without arrest" | disposition == "Open/No arrest") %>% 
  group_by(city_state) %>% 
  summarize(unsolved = n()) %>% 
  filter(city_state == "Baltimore, MD") 
```

### prop.test on Baltimore, MD

``` r
#For the city of Baltimore, MD, use the prop.test function to estimate the proportion of homicides that are unsolved; save the output of prop.test as an R object, apply the broom::tidy to this object and pull the estimated proportion and confidence intervals from the resulting tidy dataframe.

Baltimore = 
  inner_join(total_homicide, unsolved_homicide, by = "city_state")

Prop_test_baltimore =
  prop.test(Baltimore$unsolved, Baltimore$total) %>% 
  broom::tidy() %>% 
  select(estimate, conf.low, conf.high) %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 4)
  
Prop_test_baltimore
```

| estimate | conf.low | conf.high |
| -------: | -------: | --------: |
|   0.6456 |   0.6276 |    0.6632 |

### prop.test on all cities

``` r
#Now run prop.test for each of the cities in your dataset, and extract both the proportion of unsolved homicides and the confidence interval for each. Do this within a “tidy” pipeline, making use of purrr::map, purrr::map2, list columns and unnest as necessary to create a tidy dataframe with estimated proportions and CIs for each city.

total_homicide =
  homicide_data %>% 
  group_by(city_state) %>% 
  summarize(total = n())

unsolved_homicide =
  homicide_data %>%
  filter(disposition == "Closed without arrest" | disposition == "Open/No arrest") %>% 
  group_by(city_state) %>% 
  summarize(unsolved = n())

All_cities = 
  inner_join(total_homicide, unsolved_homicide, by = "city_state") 
  
prop_test_allcities = 
  All_cities %>% 
  mutate(output = map2(.x = unsolved, .y = total, ~prop.test(.x, .y)))
  #unnest()
```
